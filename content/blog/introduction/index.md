In fact I will teach her - and also you how to do this.

This streaming presence and blog is about sharing how to get started with programming focusing on automation and data challenges.
I will show you how to automate the little things in your life by learning programming - and get more time back for interesting things - or to focus on more challenging and rewarding problems.
